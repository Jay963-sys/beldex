            secret sequence of words ("Private Login Key") that you must retain
            to access your Account. 3. Privacy Policy You represent and warrant
            that you: (a) are of legal age to form a binding contract; (b) have
            not previously been suspended or removed from using our Services;
            and (c) have full power and authority to enter into this agreement

            4. Description of Services As described in more detail below, our
            Services provides in browser software that (a) generates and stores
            a Beldex account address and the associated view private key, and
            (b) facilitates the submission of Beldex transaction requests to the
            Beldex network without requiring you to personally download and
            install the associated Beldex client software. 4.1 Account Address
            and Private Key. When you create an Account, the Services (software
            in your browser), generate a pair of cryptographic private and
            public key pairs that you may use to send and receive Beldex via the
            Beldex network. The view key of the account is stored by the
            Service, which enables it to determine any transactions that are for
            your account. The private spend key is never stored or known by the
            Services, which means that it is cryptographically impossible for us
            to spend funds on your behalf. The combined public keys generated by
            the Services serve as your Beldex account address, and may be shared
            with the Beldex network and with others to complete Beldex
            transactions. The private key uniquely matches the account address
            and must be used in connection with the account address to create
            transactions to send Beldex from that account address. You are
            solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key
            and your Private Login Key. You acknowledge and agree that anybody
            that has access to your Private Login Key and/or private key pair
            will be able to access, spend or transfer the Beldex associated with
            that account address. 4.2. No Private Login Key Retrieval. Our
            Services do not receive or store your Account's Private Login Key
            nor the unencrypted private spend key. Therefore, we cannot assist
            you with Account Private Login Key retrieval. Our Services provide
            you with tools to help you reveal your Private Login Key when logged
            in, in order to facilitate backups by you, but the Services cannot
            generate a new Private Login Key for your Account. You are solely
            responsible for remembering your Account Private Login Key. IF YOU
            HAVE NOT SEPARATELY STORED A BACKUP OF ANY ACCOUNT ADDRESSES AND
            PRIVATE LOGIN KEY OR PRIVATE VIEW/SPEND KEY PAIRS MAINTAINED IN YOUR
            ACCOUNT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY Beldex YOU HAVE
            ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH ACCOUNT ADDRESSES WILL BECOME INACCESSIBLE IF
            YOU DO NOT HAVE YOUR ACCOUNT PRIVATE LOGIN KEY 4.3. Transaction
            Requests. All proposed Beldex transactions must be confirmed and
            recorded in the Beldex public ledger via the Beldex distributed
            consensus network ("Verification Network"), which is not owned,
            controlled or operated by us. The Services help you submit your
            Beldex transaction request for confirmation to the Verification
            Network. However, the Beldex network, including the Verification
            Network, is operated by a decentralized network of independent third
            parties. We have no control over the Beldex network, including the
            Verification Network, and therefore cannot and do not ensure that
            any transaction request you submit via the Services will be
            confirmed via the Verification Network. You acknowledge and agree
            that the transaction requests you submit via the Services may not be
            completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Verification
            Network. When you complete a transaction request via the Services,
            you authorize us to submit your transaction request to the
            Verification Network in accordance with the instructions you provide
            via the Services. 4.4. No Storage or Transmission of Beldex. Beldex
            (BDX) are an intangible asset, they exist only by virtue of the
            ownership record maintained in the Beldex network. The Services do
            not store, send or receive Beldex. Any transfer of title in Beldex
            occurs within the decentralized Beldex network and not within the
            Services. 4.5. Relationship. Company is an independent contractor
            for all purposes, and is not your agent or trustee. 4.6. Accuracy of
            Information. You represent and warrant that any information you
            provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You acknowledge
            and agree that the Company is not responsible for any errors or
            omissions that you make in connection with any Beldex transaction
            initiated via the Services. For instance, if you mistype an account
            address or otherwise provide incorrect information in connection
            with any transaction request to send Beldex via the Service, the
            Beldex will be sent to whatever account address or information you
            provide. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction
            request details carefully before completing any transaction requests
            via the Services. 4.7. No Cancellations or Modifications. Once a
            transaction request has been submitted to the Beldex Verification
            Network via the Services, the Verification Network will
            automatically complete or reject the request and you will not be
            able to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction request. Company
            has no control over the Beldex Verification Network and does not
            have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification
            requests. As a result, all transaction requests initiated via the
            Services are irreversible. 4.8. Taxes. It is your responsibility to
            determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you complete
            via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit
            the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that the
            Company is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to
            your Beldex transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding
            or remitting any taxes arising from any Beldex transactions. 5. Fees
            5.1. Company Fees. Access to the account is free, but the Company
            may charge fees for additional Services. Specifically, and at a
            minimum, the Company can and does charge a fee for every transaction
            that is sent. Any applicable fees will be displayed in each Service.
            5.2. Validator Fees. Overview of BeldexPOS: The Beldex Verification
            Network (described above) is operated by a network of computers that
            have installed the Beldex network software. The individuals who
            operate those computers, called "validators," voluntarily
            participate in the Verification Network confirmation process. Beldex
            validators compile a list of pending Beldex transactions, called
            "blocks," verify that each transaction in the block is valid and
            does not involve an attempt to re-spend Beldex, and solve a
            mathematical algorithm to confirm that the block should be added to
            the public ledger of confirmed blocks, called the "blockchain."
            Beldex validation is based on an on-chain consensus mechanism. The
            validator to verify the transactions in a block and solve the
            associated algorithms receive an amount of Beldex as a reward, which
            is generated automatically via the Beldex network. Since validators
            verify Beldex transactions on a voluntary basis, block rewards
            provide an incentive to the validators to add a proposed transaction
            to the next block for confirmation via the Verification Network. You
            acknowledge and agree that the Company does not receive any Miners
            Fees in connection with providing the Services, and is not
            responsible for the speed at which your transactions may be verified
            by miners. 6. Discontinuance of Services We may, in our sole
            discretion and without liability to you, with or without prior
            notice and at any time, modify or discontinue, temporarily or
            permanently, any portion of our Services. You are solely responsible
            for storing, outside of the Services, a backup of any account
            address and private key pair that you maintain in your Account. If
            you do not maintain a backup of your Account data outside of the
            Services, you will be unable to access Beldex associated with any
            account address maintained in your Account in the event that we
            discontinue the Services. 7. Assumption of Risk You acknowledge and
            agree that there are risks associated with utilizing an
            Internet-based account service including, but not limited to, the
            risk of failure of hardware, software and Internet connections, the
            risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third
            parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within
            your Account, including, but not limited to your account address,
            Private Login Key, and/or private key pair. You acknowledge and
            agree that the Company will not be responsible for any communication
            failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may
            experience when using the Services, however caused. Company takes no
            responsibility for and will not be liable for any losses, damages or
            claims arising from the use of our Services, including, but not

            data being "Bruteforced", (b) server failure or data loss, (c)
            forgotten Private Login Keys, (d) corrupted account files, (e)
            incorrectly constructed transactions or mistyped Beldex addresses;
            or (f) unauthorized access to mobile applications, (g) "phishing,"
            viruses, third-party attacks or any other unauthorized third-party
            activities. 8. Third-Party Services and Content In using our
            Services, you may view content or utilize services provided by third
            parties, including links to web pages and services of such parties
            ("Third-Party Content"). We do not control, endorse or adopt any
            Third-Party Content and will have no responsibility for Third-Party
            Content, including, without limitation, material that may be

            dealings or correspondence with such third parties are solely

            FAILURE, THEFT, DESTRUCTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO COMPANY'S

            exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of
            liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some
            of the limitations of this section may not apply to you. TO THE
            MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
            AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF COMPANY (INCLUDING OUR DIRECTORS, MEMBERS,
            EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS), WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT
            (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR IMPUTED), PRODUCT

            defend, indemnify and hold harmless Company (and each of our
            officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from
            any claim, demand, action, damage, loss, cost or expense, including
            without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out or
            relating to (a) your use of, or conduct in connection with, our
            Services; (b) any Feedback you provide; (c) your violation of these
            Terms; or (d) your violation of any rights of any other person or
            entity. If you are obligated to indemnify us, we will have the

            (at our expense) and determine whether we wish to settle it. 16.
            Applicable Law; Arbitration PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH
            CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH US AND
            IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. You and Company
            agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or your use
            of the Services, except for disputes in which either party seeks
            equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of
            copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or
            patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING
            A JURY TRIAL. You and Company agree to notify each other in writing
            of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises. Notice to
            the Company must be sent to support@beldex.io. You and Company
            further agree: (a) to attempt informal resolution prior to any
            demand for arbitration; (b) that any arbitration will occur in
            Seychelles (c) that arbitration will be conducted confidentially and
            be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the
            International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators
            appointed in accordance with the said Rule and (d) that the courts
            in Seychelles have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an
            arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject
            to arbitration. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed
            below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that
            would otherwise be available in court. Any dispute between the
            parties will be governed by these Terms and the laws of Seychelles,
            without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may
            provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.
            WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND
            COMPANY WILL NOT COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER A CLASS ACTION, CLASS
            ARBITRATION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. 17.
            Miscellaneous 17.1. Entire Agreement; Order of Precedence. These
            Terms contain the entire agreement, and supersede all prior and
            contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding the
            Services. These Terms do not alter the terms or conditions of any
            other electronic or written agreement you may have with Company for
            the Services or for any other Company product or service or
            otherwise. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any
            other agreement you may have with Company, the terms of that other
            agreement will control only if these Terms are specifically
            identified and declared to be overridden by such other agreement.
            17.2. Amendment. We reserve the right to make changes or
            modifications to these Terms from time to time, in our sole
            discretion. If we make changes to these Terms, we will provide you
            with notice of such changes, such as by sending you an email and/or
            by posting the amended Terms via the Services and updating the "Last
            Updated" date at the top of these Terms. All ￼amended Terms will
            become effective immediately on the date they are posted to the
            Services unless we state otherwise via our notice of such amended
            Terms. Any amended Terms will apply prospectively to use of the
            Services after such changes become effective. Your continued use of
            the Services following the effective date of such changes will
            constitute your acceptance of such changes. If you do not agree to
            any amended Terms, you must discontinue using the Services. 17.3.
            Waiver. Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power or
            privilege under these Terms will not operate as a waiver thereof.
            17.4. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any of
            these Terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any
            other of these Terms, all of which will remain in full force and
            effect. 17.5. Force Majeure Events. Company will not be liable for
            any loss or damage arising from any event beyond Company's
            reasonable control, including, but not limited to, flood,
            extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of God,
            fire, war, insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident, action of
            government, communications, power failure, or equipment or software
            malfunction (each, a "Force Majeure Event"). 17.6. Assignment. You
            may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under
            these Terms without prior written consent from the Company,
            including by operation of law or in connection with any change of
            control. Company may assign or transfer any or all of its rights
            under these Terms, in whole or in part, without obtaining your
            consent or approval. 17.7. Headings. Headings of sections are for
            convenience only and will not be used to limit or construe such
            sections. 17.8. Survival. 13 (Disclaimer of Warranties), 14
            (Limitation of Liability), 15 (Indemnity), 18 (Applicable Law;
            Arbitration) and this Section 17 (Miscellaneous) will survive any
            termination or expiration of these Terms.
